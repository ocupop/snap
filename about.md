## About Snap

**Snap** ("Supporting Needs and Priorities") is a database that allows staff to share and search for information about programmatic funding needs and priorities. It was developed to help us collaborate more efficiently and effectively, centralizing key details about funding needs and priorities, resources for fundraisers and those created for donors, as well as updates on fundraising progress.

Snap operationalizes the **IRC Funding Priorities Framework**, which delineates key organizational funding priorities and all other funding needs. The framework provides private sector fundraising teams with the guidance and flexibility to maximize resources, enabling better engagement with donors while also ensuring efforts are directed to the highest priorities across the organization. For more information on the IRC Funding Priorities Framework, including the Fund structure, please visit [RescueNet](https://rescuenet.rescue.org/Interact/Pages/Content/Document.aspx?id=12685).

## COVID-19 Response Update

Given the urgent need for COVID response funds, and our investment in adaptations of programs to COVID, we have updated this prioritization framework in the short-term to reflect these priorities. These needs are now included in the Rolling Priorities category alongside select match needs. During the COVID crisis, COVID response activities and program adaptations listed under “Rolling Priorities” should be prioritized for fundraising efforts above the "Durable Priorities" whenever possible. We will maintain the changes to the priorities until the needs are met or needs evolve.


Further to the framework, we have jointly developed a [CRRD Snap Entry Protocol](https://rescue.box.com/s/wakg2i0bakus01s8wg1ehkfu13lav9xp) to clarify where fundraisers can source information for different donor needs as well as focal points for information and decision-making. We will review the COVID-adapted prioritization framework and PSF process to ensure ongoing relevance and revise as/when needed.
